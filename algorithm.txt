Four Players.  

You choose Player1 and then "play" against each of the three remaining Players sequentially.  You "play" against the current player until they are out of Health Power points.
Attack Power grows with each "attack." i.e 
Attack Power Original = Attack Power at beginning of game.

Each Player has three types of points:

Attack Power
Health Power
CounterAttack Power

Playing against one Player is like this:

Player 1 has Health Power and Attack Power
Player 2 has Health Power and CounterAttack Power

1st hit (each Player attacks simultaneously, '-' is subtract)
Player1 Health Power - Player2 CounterAttack Power
Player2 Health Power - Player1 Attack Power

2nd hit
Player1 Health Power - (Player2 CounterAttack Power)
Player2 Health Power - Player1 Attack Power = (Player1 Attack Power + Player1 Attack Power Original)

How many points of the three types should each Player start with to make it possible for each Player to win if chosen as Player1.
